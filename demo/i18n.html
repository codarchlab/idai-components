        <h1>Localization | transl8 | i18n</h1>

        <p>iDAI.componentes provides a localization system which comprises two components. First it
            let applications using the library translate
            various items through the transl8 service from the arachne ecosystem. Second organized content
            can be delivered in a language dependent manner, guided by a language selection rule.</p>

        <h2>Localizable content</h2>

        <p>
            iDAI.components provides a means to organize content in a way that allows its localized
            delivery to end-users. In idai.components itself it is used to determine the language of
            the link titles of the footer and navbar, though it is intended that other applications
            make use of the content localization system to provide services to deliver localized content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The language selection gets performed
            for the requesting user individually on the basis of its selected browser language. To work properly,
            there is an underlying organization principle which has to be used accordingly.
            The available languages and organization of the items has to be done by the developer beforehand, using
            a defined data structure, so that the system can figure out which content can be delivered in
            which languages.

        <h3>Content localization: Data structure</h3>

        <p>The links from the footer and navigation bar section are directly generated from the contents
            of info/content.json (by convention). It serves us as an example to demonstrate
            the usage of the data structure.
		<pre>
{
	"children": [
	{
		"id": "navbar",
		"children":[{
			"id": "about",
			"title": {
				"de": "Ãœber Arachne",
				"en": "About Arachne"
			}
		},
	      ...
		</pre>

    <div class="col-md-6">

        <p>A few things to note:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The file containing this data structure must be named content.json.</li>
            <li>There must be exactly one root node.</li>
            <li>The identifiers must be unique.</li>
            <li>Each node can have and array of nodes as children.</li>
            <li>Each node can have the id and title fields, which make are the precondition for localization.</li>
            <li>The structure itself and the program code is of recursive nature,
                so nodes can theoretically be nested infinitely.
